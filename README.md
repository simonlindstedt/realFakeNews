# Hello you!

To install and try it out, you need to do the following:

- Have PHP installed (https://www.php.net/)

- Navigate to the root of this directory in your terminal of choice

- Launch a php server from either /dataBaseVersion or /dataBaseFreeVersion with the following command

php -S localhost:8000

- (I would recommend the /dataBaseVersion)

- Then open up your web browser och choice and enter localhost:8000 as the URL

- Approach the rest just like a normal website!
