# Hello you!

To install and try it out, you need to do the following:

-   First of all, clone this repo from

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simonlindstedt/realFakeNews.git
```

-   Have PHP installed (https://www.php.net/)

-   Also SQLite for the version of the site with a database

-   Navigate to the root of this directory in your terminal of choice

-   Launch a php server from either /dataBaseVersion or /dataBaseFreeVersion with the following command

```sh
php -S localhost:8000
```

-   (I would recommend the /dataBaseVersion, the /dataBaseFreeVersion is more of a backup in case of trouble with the sqlite-drivers)

-   Then open up your web browser och choice and enter localhost:8000 as the URL

-   Approach the rest just like a normal website!
